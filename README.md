# ROS2 Transformers
ROS2 package for deploying and fine-tuning multi-modal generalist agent models. Pre-trained RT-1 and RT-1-X models released by Google are made available as ROS inference servers. See [RoboTransformers](https://github.com/sebbyjp/robo_transformers) for a pure python implementation. RT-2 and other Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models will be coming soon.
